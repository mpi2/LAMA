#Bash script to convert DICOM files to NRRD format in batches. 
#Currenty converts DICOMs to 16-bit utype (and as such may need modifiying).  

#Dependencies: 
#     Slicer
#     dcm2niix module for Slicer (path to executable module depends on the host) - you need to also install the SlicerDcm2nii extension within Slicer


#TODO: add genotype detection by identifying 'wt' in the parent directory 
#(uCT scans are performed before genotyping to reduce bias and therefore 
#a method of simplified labelling post scanning will be required)

#TODO: double check headers are compatible with LAMA. 

#Make directory
mkdir nrrd_out

#loops through folders

    #Go within the specific DICOM directory:

    #Error trap for spaces in dicom filenames from previous PhD student
